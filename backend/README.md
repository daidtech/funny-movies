Due to time constraints and issues when initializing the repository and deployment, I initially planned to add React to Rails but faced many issues with Webpack and version conflicts. After a few hours, I decided to move to React to speed up the coding and setup time. Additionally, Next.js provides good support for deploying to Vercel, which I hope is not a problem.

Regarding testing with RSpec, I am not very familiar with it yet, so all tests are simple for now. However, I believe that after a few weeks, I will become proficient with it.

Thank you for your time.
